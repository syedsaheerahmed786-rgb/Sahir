# Guwahati Run & Rave: registration page

A booking page for **Run for All**: Sunday 11 October 2026, 6:00 AM, Jyoti Bishnu Prekhyagriha Auditorium. Entry is free and slots are limited.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | The booking page. It's a single file with no build step. |
| `apps-script/Code.gs` | The Google Sheet backend. It saves each registration as a row. |
| `register-qr.png` / `.svg` | A QR code for `https://syedsaheerahmed786-rgb.github.io/Sahir/`, for the poster. |

## 1. Connect a Google Sheet (about 5 minutes)

1. Create a new Google Sheet, for example "GRR Registrations".
2. Click **Extensions → Apps Script**. Delete what's there and paste in `apps-script/Code.gs`. To cap the slots, set `CAPACITY` (for example `300`).
3. Click **Deploy → New deployment → Web app**.
   - Execute as: **Me**
   - Who has access: **Anyone**
4. Approve the permissions prompt, then copy the **Web app URL** (it ends in `/exec`).
5. In `index.html`, open the `CONFIG` block near the bottom and set:
   ```js
   sheetEndpoint: "https://script.google.com/macros/s/XXXX/exec",
   capacity: 300   // same number as CAPACITY, or 0 to hide the counter
   ```

Each registration becomes a row in the **Registrations** tab: ID, name, mobile, email, age, gender, emergency contact and time. If someone registers again with the same mobile number, they get their existing ID back and no second row is added. When the cap is reached, the page shows "Registration closed".

**No Sheet?** Leave `sheetEndpoint` empty and set `whatsappNumber: "91XXXXXXXXXX"`. Each guest is then sent to WhatsApp with their details pre-filled, and they send that message to you.

## 2. Publish the link

**Option A: GitHub Pages (free).** In the repo, go to **Settings → Pages → Deploy from a branch**, then pick the branch and `/ (root)`. The link is
`https://syedsaheerahmed786-rgb.github.io/Sahir/`. The QR code in this repo already points to that address.

**Option B: the GRR website.** Upload `index.html` as a page, for example `yoursite.com/register`. You can also add a "Register" button that links to the GitHub Pages address. If you use the GRR website, make a new QR code for that address.

## Assamese wedding invitation writer

`invitation/index.html` is a separate page where customers fill in basic details (bride, groom, parents, date, venue, ceremonies, hosts). As they type, it writes the invitation wording in Assamese, English or both. It works out the Assamese date, weekday and time words (for example "বুধবাৰে সন্ধিয়া ৭:৩০ বজাত") and lists the programme (জোৰণ, পানী তোলা, নোওনি…). Customers can copy the text, download it, print the card, or send a short WhatsApp version. On GitHub Pages it is at `https://syedsaheerahmed786-rgb.github.io/Sahir/invitation/`.

All of the wording is in `invitation/templates.js`: opening lines, tradition (Hindu, Vaishnav, Muslim, general), honorifics, relations, ceremonies and each paragraph. To change what the generator writes, or add more wordings for "Another wording" to cycle through, edit that file. You don't need to touch the page.
